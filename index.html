                    Arch linux is <b>" a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple."</b>
              . It was Created By Aaron Griffin and Judd Vinet.
                  The point of Arch linux is to be as flexible as possible, and to give freedom of choice to the user
                based on their own personal preferences, not on the developers of the distribution. Judd Vinet has since left the Arch linux project, but Aaron Griggin continues to maintain it.</p>

              <p> There are many reasons to chose arch linux. Many people choose to use arch to breath life into an old machine, as it comes with no heavy desktop environment on installation, and doesn't utilize any unnecessary
              applications. Therefore, Arch has very low system requirements. An additional and very much related reason would simply be the amount of customization that can be done. With arch, you can literally change everything
              about the os. You can change your desktop environment. You can change your bootlogo.You can even decide what kind of bootloader you'd like to use. This makes it ideal for those who simply want a customizable, flexible
              linux experience, something which distributions like ubuntu simply don't give to the fullest extent. </p>

                  <p>Arch linux has an advanced package manager. Called pacman, short for package manager, pacman is flexible, well optimized, and extremely versatile, with options to install packages from
                  online repos, or from source like any modern package manager. In combination with the arch build system, which makes building packages easy, installing packages with arch is quite convenient, though
                configuring them may be a different story. </p>
